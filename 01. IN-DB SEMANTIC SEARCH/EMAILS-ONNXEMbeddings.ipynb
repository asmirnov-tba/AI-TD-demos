    "# Teradata as Embeddings Storage. Semantic search\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Embeddings are revolutionizing the way we process and understand text data. These dense vector representations capture the semantic essence of words, phrases, and even entire documents, enabling machines to grasp nuanced meanings and relationships within the data. Imagine a high-dimensional space where each point represents a word, phrase, or document as a vector. The position of each point is determined by the context in which it appears, meaning similar concepts are located closer together.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the words \"king\" and \"queen\" would have vectors that are close to each other, as would \"Paris\" and \"France.\" This spatial proximity allows embeddings to capture intricate relationships and patterns that traditional keyword-based methods miss.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike traditional keyword-based search methods, embedding-based search leverages these rich representations to find relevant information based on context and meaning rather than exact word matches. This is where cosine similarity comes into play. By measuring the cosine of the angle between vectors, cosine similarity allows us to quantify how similar two embeddings are, effectively identifying the most relevant documents or texts. This technique is crucial in applications ranging from information retrieval and recommendation systems to natural language understanding, providing more accurate and meaningful search results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Illustration of Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "To visualize embeddings, imagine a 2D plot (though embeddings typically exist in much higher dimensions):\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](img/embeddings_1.jpg \"Embeddings: King and Queen, Paris and France\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this illustration:\n",
    "- \"King\" and \"Queen\" are close together, indicating they are semantically similar.\n",
    "- \"Paris\" and \"France\" are also close together, showing a geographical relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using embeddings, we can better understand and search through our data in ways that are meaningful and contextually relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo, we showcase an advanced approach to embedding-based search using the Teradata database. Our methodology involves several key steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Importing and Converting Model**: We begin by importing pre-trained models from Hugging Face, which are renowned for their ability to capture semantic meanings in text data effectively. To enhance performance and ensure compatibility with various execution environments, we convert these Hugging Face models into the ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) format using the [`optimum`](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum) utility.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Deployment to Database to be Used with BYOM**: Leveraging Teradata's BYOM (Bring Your Own Model) capability, we deploy the model directly within the Teradata database. This integration minimizes data movement and optimizes performance by keeping the model execution close to the data storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **In-Database Embedding Generation and Building the Embedding Store**: We execute the embedding generation process directly within the Teradata database. Each text entry in our knowledge base is processed to create its corresponding embedding vector, which is then stored in a structured repository for efficient retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Semantic Search with Cosine Similarity**: Finally, we utilize Teradata’s functionality to calculate cosine similarity between a query embedding and the embeddings stored in the database. Cosine similarity, which measures the angle between two vectors, effectively determines their similarity. This enables us to perform semantic searches directly within the database, retrieving the most relevant results based on the meaning of the text rather than exact keyword matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of this approach is that the data never leaves the database. This ensures data security and compliance while reducing latency and improving efficiency, as all operations are performed close to where the data resides.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach combines state-of-the-art embedding models with Teradata's robust data management and processing capabilities, facilitating efficient and accurate semantic searches at scale.\n",
    "\n",
